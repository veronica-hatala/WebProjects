	I learned I was a "Green" personality type. I'm always looking to learn and setting high standards for myself. I learned about how my values affects where I will be happy working 
	- working at a company that doesn't align with my personal values will probably not be sustainable for me long-term.
	I learned I was an introvert that gets my energy from being alone, so I need time (whether at work or at home) to relax by myself.

	>I learned the technical skills involved in creating and deploying a WordPress website on a live hosting platform. WordPress is a CMS that makes it easier to create, update, 
	and keep track of content. WordPress is able to work with many plugins built for the platform, streamlining its functionality. You are able to make beautiful websites quickly with WordPress!
I learned communication skills that will be beneficial in a Canadian work environment no matter what job I work in. Learning how to write a good, clear email is really important. 
I am most proud of being able to work on a real website that will continue to be updated. It's nice to know that my website will be used practically and will be useful to users!

	I learned that my previous resume wasn't that good - I left out a lot of relevant experience through volunteer work, and I left out many of my skills that I learned outside of
	paid work experience. Networking is so important when looking for a job. Attending recruitment sessions, job fairs, and industry lectures/seminars can be great ways to learn 
	about the companies you can work for. LinkedIn has also been a great way to connect with people in your field, especially during the pandemic when in-person networking can't 
	happen.

	>I'm nervous about the uncertainty. I applied for graduate school and I've been applying for summer internships, and I haven't had any offers yet, but it's still early. 
	Not knowing where I'll be working or where I'll be going to school gives me anxiety. However I'm excited to keep making progress in my career and continue learning new things. 
	This summer I would like to gain new experiences whether it is through paid or volunteer work. Through INC I feel much more confident about sending out resumes and personalizing 
	cover letters to the particular job I'm applying to. I am using LinkedIn and trying to network as much as possible in Covid times.
